For this project I aim to develop a virtual makeup shopping experience using Python. The program will be an interactive makeup store where users can browse through a selection of virtual makeup products, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to a checkout process. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for makeup users to explore and virtually purchase makeup products in a fun and engaging way. I also plan to incorporate features such as detailed product information and a makeup recommendation system.

They can browse products:
Products will be displayed with a list of makeup products with details such as name, brand, price, and availability.

Virtual Shopping Cart:
User should be able to add products they want to buy to a virtual shopping cart.

Makeup Recommended Products:
Based on the products users click on there will be a recommendation system which suggests additional makeup products based on the user's selections or preferences. This will show up on the bottom of their shopping cart or while they are looking at a product.
